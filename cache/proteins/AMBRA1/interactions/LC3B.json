It is a core component of the BECLIN1-PI3KC3 complex, which acts upstream of LC3B to initiate autophagosome formation. Additionally, AMBRA1 functions as a direct mitophagy receptor by binding LC3B via a LIR motif to tether damaged mitochondria to the autophagosome for clearance.",

Upon autophagy induction (e.g., by ULK1 phosphorylation), AMBRA1 promotes the translocation of the complex from the cytoskeleton to the endoplasmic reticulum, the site of autophagosome nucleation. It also mediates the K63-linked ubiquitination of BECLIN1, which enhances the kinase activity of the complex.",
